<h1> Coin Toss (Heads or Tails) ðŸŸ¡</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is a website that features ten different coin images, each to be determined as heads or tails. When the user clicks the "toss" button, each of the coins is randomly assigned to heads or tails. The website would then count up how many are heads or tails. It will also calculate the frequency percentage of a coin being heads or it being tails. As the user continues to press toss, the website will continue to add to the heads or tails frequency count, along with calculating the percentage.
